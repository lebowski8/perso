@article{Krogt2005,
	abstract = {In dynamic environments, agents have to deal with chang- ing situations. In these cases, repairing a plan is often more efficient than planning from scratch, but existing planning techniques are more advanced than existing plan repair tech- niques. Therefore, we propose a straightforward method to extend planning techniques such that they are able to repair plans. This is possible, because plan repair consists of two different operations: (i) removing actions, and (ii) adding ac- tions. Adding actions is similar to planning, but planning heuristics can also be used for removing actions, which we call unrefinement. We present a plan repair template that re- flects these two operations, and we present a heuristic for un- refinement that uses arbitrary existing planning techniques. We show that the resulting method is much better than re- planning from scratch, and also significantly better than an- other plan repair method (GPG). Furthermore, we show that the plan repair template is a generalisation of existing plan repair methods.},

Current strategies for plan repair are basically aimed at solving problems where regular minor modifications in the initial or goal state occur in the plan. In this paper, we propose a new repair technique that identifies where the problem is located, which part of the plan needs to be repaired and it fixes the affected part of the plan. Our technique is capable to tackle any type of failure or modification in the plan.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach to coordinate two temporal plans, where one plan is for the achievement of a reactive goal, and thus has more priority, while the other is for the achievement of a proactive goal. As both plans have been computed independently from each other, conflicts can arise during their execution. We present a plan merging algorithm to coordinate the actions of both plans. Unlike many other plan merging approaches, which use only the actions present in both plans to coordinate them, our approach is supported by a sound plan repairing approach, to deal with the situations where both plans can not be merged as they are i.e. when one plan uses the same resource needed by the other plan and then does not release the resource. The plan repairing algorithm uses an extension of the well known planner Sapa, to repair a plan in the presence of another plan, and thus taking into account the constraints imposed by the latter. Our approach is generic and can be used in different situations of coordination between multiple agents and within a single agent.},

	abstract = {In the collaborative multi-agent systems where agents' goals are prioritized, an agent often needs to be more flexible in the pursuit of its own goals, for the sake of the higher priority goals of the others. In such situations, finding an optimal plan under the constraints imposed by the other agents' plans, is really an important area which needs more investigation. This work aims to fill this gap by studying two different situations in a similar context. In the first situation, which we call Coordinated Planning, an agent has to compute a temporal plan for the achievement of its own goals, but without violating the constraints of another agent's plan, and utilizing where possible the cooperative opportunities offered by the latter. For this purpose, we propose Coordinated-Sapa an extension to the well known planner Sapa, which aims to deal with negative and positive interactions. In the second situation, which we call Proactive-Reactive Coordination, an agent has to modify its plan in order to remove any conflicts with the plan of another agent, having high priority goals. We propose a plan merging algorithm supported by a sound plan repair technique to solve this problem.},

	abstract = {Several successful autonomous systems are separated into technologically diverse functional layers operating t different levels of abstraction. This diversity makes them difficult to implement and validate. In this paper, we present IDEA (Intelligent Distributed Execution Architecture) a unified planning and execution framework. In IDEA a layered system can be implemented as separate agents, one per layer, each representing its interactions with the world in a model. At all levels, the model representation primitives and their semantics are the same. Moreover, each agent relies on a single model, plan database, plan runner and on a variety of planners, both reactive and deliberative. The framework allows the specification of agents that operate within a guaranteed reaction time and supports flexible specification of reactive vs. deliberative agent behaviour. Within the IDEA framework we are working to fully duplicate the functionalities of the DS1 Remote Agent and extend it to domains of higher complexity than autonomous spacecraft control.},
